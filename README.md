# SM Teams

A SourceMod plugin for managing pre-made teams in a TF2 match
organized on some 3rd party platform. It provides commands for setting
up a list of players (specified by SteamID) who are allowed to play in
a server, along with aliases they should be named as.

This plugin is heavily copied from parts of
[PugChamp](https://github.com/fwdcp/pugchamp)'s "pugchamp-control"
plugin, originally for use with TF2Stadium, but designed to be
generally applicable to other uses as well.
